# What Are Atlas Embeddings?

[TBD - insert description here - discuss the following 1) where did these embeddings come from 2) what are the dimensions]

Altas is a retrieval-augmented language model created by Meta AI research team. They use the Wikipedia corpora as its raw data to retrieve texts and documents. The total size of the dataset is around 25M with the embedding size of 768. These embeddings are created with an information retrieval technique: Contriever, which is based on continuous dense embeddings.
